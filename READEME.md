# Data Visualization Projects
## #MakeoverMonday
 Makeover Monday is a free platform for passionate data people to explore data set and create more effective visualizations.

I created my first #MakeoverMonday viz on June 6, 2020. By doing so, I  had the chance not only to practice my data wrangling and data visualization skills but also to discover different approaches used by other analysts to visualize the data. Since then, I decided to block one hour every Monday to create a MakeoverMonday viz using Tableau.
